<br />
Course on vibration-based SHM, spanning from basic concepts <br />
of SHM and general pathologies in civil engineering structures, <br />
frequency-domain and time-domain OMA techniques, until <br />
damage detection algorithms following the pattern recognition paradigm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All the theoretical concepts are illustrated with codes written <br />
