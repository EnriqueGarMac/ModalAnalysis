    The real mode shape should have the maximum correlation with

    with the complex mode, is the real part of the complex mode when it is
    rotated so that the norm of its real part is maximized. [1]

    ``max_dof`` and ``long`` arguments are given for modes that have
    a large number of degrees of freedom. See ``_large_normal_mode_approx()``

        more closely related to the ones computed with an entire matrix. Defaults to True.

    In cases, where ``mode`` has ``n`` coordinates and

    matrix is computationally expensive. The solution is to
    find the angle of the rotation for the vector - this is
    done using only every ``step`` element of ``mode``.
    The entire ``mode`` is then rotated, thus the full normal
    mode is obtained.
    
    To ensure the influence of all the coordinates, a ``long``
    parameter can be used. Multiple angles of rotation are
